# Overview

**PLC Question 4 in Action**

At its core, this initiative is about building a deeper, shared understanding of what teaching and learning truly look like in our classrooms. By consistently observing and reflecting on instructional practice, we create a foundation for meaningful professional growth, informed decision-making, and lasting change. This is not about compliance or evaluation—it’s about using real evidence to improve our practice, strengthen our culture, and ensure every student experiences high-quality, culturally responsive learning every day.

| SMART Goal |
| :---- |

By May 2026, school leaders collectively will gather 5,000 observation data points across classrooms, with the goal of seeing evidence of CRP in at least 70% of those observations, as measured by a standardized “look-for” tool that incorporates CRP, the 7Cs of Learning, and 5 Daily Assessment Practices, CASEL, and inclusive practices. Leaders will review the data on a quarterly basis and use the data to plan faculty meetings and professional learning. 

| Theory of Action |
| :---- |

If school leaders consistently use a standardized observation tool to collect and analyze classroom data focused on Culturally Responsive Practices (CRP), the Tripod, SEL, and the 5 Daily Assessment Practices, and if they engage in regular, data-informed reflection and planning to guide professional learning, then they will develop a shared and actionable understanding of high-leverage, equitable teaching practices, which will lead to more intentional integration of CRP in instruction and in the design of professional learning experiences.

As a result, we expect to see CRP evident in at least 70% of classroom observations by May 2026\.

| Alignment with 2025-2026 Strategic Priorities |
| :---- |

This initiative directly supports our two strategic priorities by embedding a consistent, equity-focused lens into instructional leadership. By using a standardized observation tool that integrates Culturally Responsive Practices (CRP), the 7Cs of Learning, and the 5 Daily Assessment Practices, school leaders will regularly gather actionable data on classroom culture, relationships, and instructional quality.

**\#1 Strengthen culture through our commitment to social-emotional well-being and belonging.** 

For Priority \#1, the focus on CRP and the 7Cs—particularly *Caring*, *Confer*, and *Challenge*—supports the development of learning environments where all students feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional safety. As leaders observe and highlight practices that foster connection and inclusion, they are reinforcing a school-wide commitment to social-emotional well-being.

**\#2 Strengthen PLC practices to ensure high-quality, culturally responsive teaching in every learning space.**

For Priority \#2, regular observation data tied to instructional practice allows PLCs to engage in more meaningful, targeted dialogue. By reviewing trends and patterns each quarter, teams can celebrate strengths, identify gaps, and co-design professional learning focused on high-impact, culturally responsive teaching strategies. This elevates the PLC process from compliance to collective efficacy.

| Current vs. Future State of Classroom Observations and Data Collection |
| :---- |

While divisional leaders, PLC coaches, and members of the Office of Learning (OOL) do conduct classroom observations, the process is currently inconsistent across the school. There is no shared system for collecting data, and observers often look for different things depending on their role, background, or area of focus. As a result, some teachers report not having been observed in years, and many are unsure of the purpose or outcomes of an observation.

Observers, likewise, often leave classrooms without a clear plan for how to use what they’ve seen to support teacher growth. The lack of a common observation framework contributes to this uncertainty and limits the usefulness of observations as a lever for professional learning. Additionally, the variety of initiatives and instructional goals across divisions creates further fragmentation, with no unified method for understanding how classroom practices align with schoolwide priorities.

Many school leaders express a desire to be in classrooms more frequently, but are unsure how to translate those visits into meaningful feedback or improvements in instructional practice.

| Current State | Desired Future State |
| ----- | ----- |
| Observations are happening, but inconsistently and without coordination. | All school leaders are actively involved in a structured, schoolwide observation process. |
| No shared system for collecting or analyzing observation data. | 5,000+ observation data points are collected and reviewed using a shared, standardized tool. |
| Observers look for different things depending on role or initiative. | A consistent “look-for” tool aligned to CRP, 7Cs, and 5 Daily Assessment Practices guides all observations. |
| Some teachers report not being observed for years. | All teachers receive frequent, consistent observations with clear follow-up. |
| Teachers are unsure what to expect before, during, or after an observation. | Observation protocols are transparent; teachers know the purpose, process, and follow-up steps. |
| Observers are unsure how to use the information gathered. | Observation data informs quarterly leadership reviews and drives professional learning. |
| Multiple instructional initiatives exist, but there's not a cohesive lens for classroom practice. | Observations help unify instructional focus across initiatives through shared evidence and common language. |
| Leaders want to visit classrooms more, but don’t always see how it leads to improvement. | Leaders see observations as a key lever for strengthening culture, PLCs, and instructional quality. |

# How the Process Works

| How the Process Works: CRP in Action |
| :---- |

At first glance, the goal of 5,000 observations might seem ambitious—but when we break it down, it becomes something entirely achievable *together*. This initiative isn’t about adding more to our plates—it’s about being intentional with the time we *already* want to spend in classrooms, and aligning that time with a shared purpose: improving teaching and learning through culturally responsive, high-quality instruction.

Using the **Integrated Observation Tool**, which combines Culturally Responsive Practices (CRP), the 7Cs of Learning, and the 5 Daily Assessment Practices, our team of **80 observers**—including principals, directors, coordinators, PLC coaches, DEI specialists, and other instructional leaders—will collectively reach the 5,000-visit goal.

Each observation is brief, just **10–15 minutes**, and designed to be low-lift but high-impact. When distributed across all observers, it breaks down to:

* 62 visits per year per observer

* That’s just 15.5 hours annually

* Or 16 visits per quarter (\~4 hours total)

* Which is just 2 visits per week—30 minutes

This approach makes time in classrooms a **priority**, not an extra. It creates a consistent practice that builds leadership visibility, supports teacher growth, and ensures we’re collectively focused on what matters most: creating classrooms where every learner is seen, supported, and challenged. Moreover, the data we gather through these observations will directly inform our decision-making and guide professional learning, helping us continuously refine our practices to meet the needs of both teachers and students.

| Data-Management |
| :---- |

**Collection**  
Observations will be documented using a short online form filled out by each observer. The form will capture key data including the observer’s name, the educator observed, and responses to 10 “look-fors” aligned with the various frameworks such as CRP, 7Cs, and 5 Daily Assessment Practices. Additionally, observers will include brief notes about the observation and confirm a note to the teacher. Once submitted, this data will automatically feed into a dashboard that links each observed "look-for" with its corresponding framework, ensuring a streamlined and consistent data collection process.

**Data Management**  
The data will be stored and organized in a centralized dashboard, allowing easy tracking of observations by observer, educator, and specific observation data. This system will facilitate both aggregate and detailed data analysis, enabling us to view trends across the school and among individual teachers. However, it’s important to note that this data is not intended to be evaluative; it serves as a tool to inform and support professional growth, not as a means of assessing individual performance.

**Analyzing the Data**  
Leadership teams will include a 5-minute agenda item in their weekly meetings to reflect on the observations conducted. The team will discuss which classrooms were visited, what was observed, and which teachers should be prioritized for future visits, particularly those who haven’t been observed yet. At the end of each quarter, Ed Leaders will dedicate meeting time to analyze divisional and school-wide data. This analysis will help identify trends, strengths, and areas for growth. Based on these insights, teams will create action plans to address areas of development, which will be reflected in upcoming faculty meetings and professional learning sessions.

# IO Rubric

**Integrated Observation Rubric**

| Level | Descriptor |
| ----- | ----- |
| **4 – Clearly Observable** | The practice was clearly evident during the visit. There were multiple cues or interactions that aligned with the look-for in a way that supported student learning, engagement, or belonging. |
| **3 – Possibly Present** | There were some indicators that the practice may be in place, but the short window or lesson segment made it difficult to determine fully. Evidence was emerging but not conclusive. |
| **2 – Unclear or Minimal** | There were few or subtle signs of the practice, and it was not clearly observable in this short visit. This may be due to timing, lesson structure, or other factors. |
| **1 – Not Evident in This Moment** | The practice was not seen during the observation window. This does not mean it isn’t part of the teacher’s broader practice—it just wasn’t visible during this segment. |
| **Not Observed** | This look-for wasn’t applicable or wasn’t possible to observe in the context of this particular visit (e.g., the lesson didn’t include collaborative work or student reflection). |

**Subject:** Introducing *CRP in Action: Leading with Observation* – A Collaborative Process for Understanding and Strengthening Teaching & Learning

Dear Colleagues,

As part of our ongoing commitment to building a culture of belonging and ensuring high-quality, culturally responsive teaching in every learning space, we’re launching a new shared practice: **CRP in Action: Leading with Observation**.

### **What is this about?**

This process is not about evaluation—it’s about **collectively understanding what’s happening in our classrooms** and using that information to guide change, professional learning, and school improvement. Through consistent, short observations and shared data, we’ll deepen our instructional leadership, highlight effective practices, and identify areas where additional support or growth is needed.

**What’s the goal?**

By **May 2026**, our collective goal is to complete **5,000 classroom observations** using a simple, shared tool aligned to:

* Culturally Responsive Practices   
* CASEL social-emotional learning standards  
* Panorama student experience data (relationships & belonging)  
* Tripod’s 7Cs of effective teaching  
* 5 Daily Assessment Practices

### **What does it require?**

Each observation lasts **10–15 minutes**. With **80+ observers** across the school (principals, coordinators, DEI specialists, coaches, directors), this breaks down to:

* \~62 total observations per observer per year (\~15.5 hours total)  
* \~16 per quarter (\~4 hours)  
* Just 2 short visits per week (\~30 minutes)

This is **not extra work**—this is the work of instructional leadership. We are simply making time for it and focusing our lens.

### **How does it work?**

* Observers will use a short **online observation form** to record responses to 8–10 shared “look-fors.”  
* Each look-for is aligned to our shared frameworks and includes a short rubric to guide consistency.  
* Observers will also confirm whether they’ve had a brief follow-up conversation with the teacher.  
* Data will flow into a **dashboard** that allows us to see trends by school, division, and role—without identifying teachers.  
* **Weekly team meetings** will include a 5-minute reflection on recent observations: What did you see? Who hasn’t been observed yet?  
* **Quarterly data reviews** will inform faculty meeting plans, PD, and next steps.

We will offer short calibration and onboarding sessions to walk you through the tool and process before we begin.

Thank you for committing to this thoughtful and collaborative work. Our classrooms are rich with insight—and by being present, curious, and aligned, we can grow together.

**Subject:** Follow-Up from Classroom Observation

Dear \[Teacher’s Name\],

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to observe your class today. It was a pleasure seeing the positive energy and engagement in your classroom.

During the observation, I focused on several key areas: **Culturally Responsive Practices**, **SEL strategies**, **5 Daily Assessment Practices**, **student-teacher relationships**, and the **7Cs from Tripod**. 

I was particularly impressed by \[mention specific positive practices, e.g., “your use of culturally relevant content to engage students, the clear communication of learning targets, and the supportive interactions between you and your students”\].

Your efforts are making a meaningful impact on creating a supportive, engaging, and inclusive learning environment for all students. Keep up the great work\!

Thank you again for your dedication to our students' success.

Best regards,

| For Educators |

**Subject:** What to Expect for Observations

Dear Teachers,

This year, the focus of school leaders’ classroom observations will be a shared practice. This is not about evaluation—it’s about learning for leaders. Our aim is to spend more time in classrooms, better understand what teaching and learning look like across the school, and use that information to support instructional growth and student success.

### **What’s the purpose?**

We currently use a number of important frameworks to guide our work—Culturally Responsive Practices, CASEL’s SEL standards, Panorama data on student experience, Tripod’s 7Cs, and the 5 Daily Assessment Practices. This observation focus brings all of these together in a clear, unified way and connects them directly to what’s happening in classrooms every day.

It’s also about ensuring that leaders have a deeper understanding of the **real work teachers are doing**—the strategies, the relationships, and the complexity of day-to-day instruction. The goal is to learn from what we see and use that learning to inform professional development, collaboration, and support.

### **What should I expect?**

* You may have several short visits per semester from school leaders, coordinators, or coaches. Each visit will last just **10–15 minutes**.  
* Observers will use a shared tool with a small set of “look-fors” aligned to our instructional and cultural priorities.  
* This is **not evaluative**. You will not receive a score or rating.  
* You may be invited to have a brief follow-up conversation—just a chance to share reflections or ask clarifying questions.

### **Why does this matter?**

You’re doing meaningful, complex work every day. By observing intentionally and consistently, leaders can:

* Highlight effective practices already in place  
* Understand student and teacher experiences across classrooms  
* Make better-informed decisions about professional learning and schoolwide improvement

Thank you for welcoming us into your classrooms. We’re grateful for your work and excited to learn alongside you.

# Sample Data Reports

| Sample Data Reports and Data Analysis Protocol |
| :---- |

### **What the Data Will Look Like**

* Each observation submitted via the short online form will include:

  * The **observer and educator** involved  
  * A rating (1–4 or Not Observed) for each **look-for**  
  * **Brief notes** on context or evidence seen  
  * A simple checkbox confirming whether there was a short **teacher follow-up**

* All data feeds into a live **dashboard** that:

  * Aggregates scores for each look-for  
  * Links each look-for to its aligned framework(s)  
  * Breaks down data by **division, team, content area**, or **observer**  
  * Tracks **who has been observed and how frequently**

### **What the Data Will Tell Us**

* **Instructional Strengths and Gaps:**  
  Identify trends in strong practices (e.g., high levels of clarity and collaboration) and areas for growth (e.g., fewer examples of student self-assessment or inclusive representation).

* **Framework Integration:**  
  Show how well practices aligned to CRP, SEL, assessment, etc., are embedded in daily instruction—not just discussed in theory.

* **Equity of Observation:**  
  Monitor which teachers or teams are being regularly observed and who may be overlooked, helping ensure equitable support and visibility.

* **Informed Professional Learning:**  
  Provide evidence to guide faculty meetings, PLC discussions, and targeted PD—based on real classroom data, not assumptions.

* **Instructional Culture Shift:**  
  Over time, reveal how practice evolves across the school as a result of focus, reflection, and aligned leadership.

![Output image][image1]

Here’s a sample data report visualizing the **average ratings** for each instructional practice from your look-for tool. This kind of report could be generated from your dashboard to show schoolwide or divisional trends.

You can quickly see:

* Which practices are being observed more frequently (e.g., “Learning target is clearly communicated” and “Strong student-teacher relationships”).

* Which practices may need more support or clarity (e.g., “Inclusive representation in content” or “Opportunities for student reflection”).

![Output image][image2]

Here's a breakdown of the **average ratings by framework alignment**, based on the look-fors that align with each:

* This view helps show which **frameworks are being more successfully implemented** in practice.

* For example, look-fors aligned to **CRP** and **Tripod 7Cs** may be rated more strongly, while areas like **Assessment** may reveal opportunities for focused professional learning.

![Output image][image3]

Here’s a breakdown showing the **average observation rating by each observer**. This view highlights potential differences in observer focus or calibration and can support coaching conversations and norming across your leadership team.

---

There are several meaningful and accessible ways teams could analyze the observation data to inform practice and guide professional learning. Here are a few options:

**By Look-For**

* Identify which practices are most commonly observed and which are rarely seen.  
* Focus professional learning on underdeveloped practices (e.g., student reflection or inclusive content).

### **By Framework**

* Examine average ratings and frequency by framework (e.g., CRP, SEL, Tripod 7Cs, Assessment).  
* Track growth over time in a specific framework focus area.

### **By Observer**

* Check for balance—Are all observers contributing observations?  
* Support observer calibration—Are there rating discrepancies to explore together?

### **By Division, Grade Level, or Subject Area**

* Spot trends across teams—Are there differences in implementation across grade levels or departments?  
* Celebrate divisional strengths and tailor learning accordingly.

### **By Educator (non-evaluative)**

* Ensure broad participation—Have all teachers been observed at least once per quarter?  
* Support targeted instructional coaching without assigning judgment.

### **Over Time**

* Track change in frequency or average ratings over quarters.  
* Use data to evaluate the impact of PD and make course corrections.

### **Connected to Action**

* At the end of each quarter, ask:

  * “What practices are strong and should be shared more widely?”  
  * “What are patterns of need we should address in our faculty learning?”  
  * “Who might benefit from peer support or coaching?”

## Observation Data Analysis Protocol (Quarterly)

**Purpose:**  
 To collaboratively analyze observation data, identify patterns of strength and growth across classrooms, and plan actionable next steps for professional learning.

---

### **Step 1: Prepare and Preview (Before the Meeting)**

* Share the dashboard or summary data with leaders ahead of time.

* Ask each participant to review:

  * Aggregate data by look-for, framework, division/grade band.  
  * Any patterns they notice (strengths, gaps, trends).

---

### **Step 2: Data Review (10–15 min)**

* In small groups or divisions, review the dashboard together.  
* Focus on these guiding questions:  
  * What practices are most frequently observed?  
  * What practices are less consistently observed?  
  * Where do we see evidence of culturally responsive practices, SEL, and strong assessment practices?  
  * Are there any surprising patterns by grade level, division, or framework?

---

### **Step 3: Identify Strengths and Gaps (10 min)**

* Groups identify:  
  * **Strength Areas**: 1–2 practices that are emerging as consistent strengths.  
  * **Growth Areas**: 1–2 practices that need strengthening across classrooms.

---

### **Step 4: Connect to Action (10–15 min)**

* For each Growth Area, discuss:  
  * What support, resources, or learning experiences could help strengthen this practice?  
  * What structures (e.g., PLC focus, model lessons, coaching cycles) could help?  
  * What bright spots can we highlight in faculty meetings or newsletters?

---

### **Step 5: Document and Plan (5–10 min)**

* Record group insights.  
* Agree on 1–2 priorities for divisional or school-wide professional learning over the next quarter.  
* Decide how you will share positive trends and next steps with faculty (e.g., at faculty meetings, divisional newsletters).

---

# **Key Mindsets**

* **Non-evaluative**: We are analyzing patterns, not judging individuals.  
* **Instruction-centered**: Focus on teaching and learning, not compliance.  
* **Collective growth**: Celebrate progress and make plans to improve together.

This tool helps us:

* Understand what’s happening in classrooms across the school.  
* Highlight strengths and identify areas for collective growth.  
* Align multiple frameworks (CRP, CASEL, 7Cs, Assessment Practices, Inclusion) to what we actually see in classrooms.  
* Support professional learning based on real classroom practice.

---

## **2\. Plan Your Visit**

* Aim for **2 visits per week** (\~30 minutes total).  
* Each visit lasts **10–15 minutes**.  
* Visit a variety of grade levels, content areas, and educators.  
* Choose classrooms that haven’t been observed recently.

---

## **3\. What to Look For**

During your visit, use the tool to observe for:

* **Culturally Responsive Practices**   
* **Social-Emotional Learning (CASEL-aligned)**   
* **Inclusive Practices**   
* **Tripod 7Cs: Care, Challenge, Clarify, etc.**   
* **Daily Assessment Practices** 

You don’t need to see *everything*—just look for what’s evident in that moment.

---

## **4\. Complete the Observation Tool**

After the visit (ideally the same day), complete the short online form:

* Select the educator observed.  
* Rate each **look-for** using the rubric (or choose “Not Observed”).  
* Add brief notes or examples (optional but helpful).  
* Confirm that you’ll send a short follow-up email.

The tool auto-saves to the dashboard for schoolwide data tracking.

---

## **5\. Send a Follow-Up Email**

* Send a short, friendly message that highlights what you were looking for and what you saw.  
* Keep the tone **positive and appreciative**.  
* No post-observation meeting required.

(We’ve provided a template email you can personalize.)

---

## **6\. Reflect Weekly**

In your team meetings:

* Share where you visited and what stood out.  
* Note any teachers who haven’t been observed recently.  
* Use 5 minutes to stay aligned and intentional.

---

## **7\. Quarterly Review**

Each quarter, we’ll:

* Look at school- and division-level trends.  
* Identify bright spots and areas to strengthen.  
* Use the data to shape professional learning and coaching priorities.

---

### **Final Reminders:**

* You are not evaluating teachers—you're building collective insight.  
* A single visit is a snapshot; patterns matter more than isolated moments.  
* Stay curious, positive, and focused on growth.
