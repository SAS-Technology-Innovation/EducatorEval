- ✅ Added missing CRUD methods (Delete, Update operations)

**3. Code Structure & Syntax**
- ✅ Added missing closing braces and main functions for local testing
- ✅ Fixed import statements and removed unused imports
- ✅ Resolved file encoding issues

**4. Model & API Integration**
- ✅ Enhanced Applet model with missing fields (IsActive, SupportedDivisions, etc.)
- ✅ Added missing fields to SchoolAppletConfig (ScheduleSettings, NotificationSettings)
- ✅ Extended CurrentUser middleware with DivisionType field
- ✅ Fixed function parameter handling and pointer references

**5. Service Layer Completion**
- ✅ Added missing Firestore service methods (DeleteSchool, UpdateDivision, UpdateDepartment, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented RecordAppletLaunch for usage tracking
- ✅ Fixed method signatures and parameter handling

### 🏗️ Core Platform Architecture Validated

2. **Frontend Integration** - APIs ready for Astro/React integration  
3. **Applet Development** - Foundation supports extensible applet system
4. **Production Testing** - Complete end-to-end functionality

### 🎯 Key Capabilities Confirmed

✅ **User Management**: Complete CRUD, role assignment, bulk operations
✅ **Organization Management**: School hierarchy with proper access control  
✅ **Applet System**: Registry-based, configurable, permission-controlled
✅ **Security**: Comprehensive role-based access control
✅ **Extensibility**: Ready for custom educational applets
